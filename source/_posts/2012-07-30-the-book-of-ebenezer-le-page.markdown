# The Book of Ebenezer le Page
## by G.B. Edwards

One of the best books I've read, based on nothing other than the fact
that I felt so after reading it. Yes, the ending wavers a bit, as, and

    thousands of Christians of all shapes and sizes on this island. They
    may not all of them go after the flesh-pots, though some of them do on
    the sly; but they go to war and kill other people, and in peace-time
    make as much money as they can out of each other, and don't love their
    neighbours any more than I do.'

    perhaps she didn't like anybody at all really; but only liked being
    good and kind.
