found raymond's humpty rejoinder to ebenezer's question of why he doesn't return to christine regardless of her vileness, awesome:

> humpty dumpty sat on a great wall,
>
> humpty dumpty had a great fall,
>
> all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put humpty together again

perhaps better to just mention the last line, and indirectly invoke the rest, still awesome.
