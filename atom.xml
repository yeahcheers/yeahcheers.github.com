    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>by G.B. Edwards</h2>

<p>One of the best books I&#8217;ve read, based on nothing other than the fact
that I felt so after reading it. Yes, the ending wavers a bit, as, and
likely for, the reason the introduction hints at, but overall it was
such an authentic piece of writing. Refreshing.</p>

<p>Here are some quotes:</p>

<pre><code>They say children are born because of the love the parents have for each other. I haven't noticed that myself. Perhaps the children are born because the love of the parents for each other is not perfect. Perhaps the children come into the world through a gap between the parents.
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>Well, if you want to have wars, you got to have whores.
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>'I don't know what a pagan is,' I said, 'so I don't know if I am one or not; but I don't know what a Christian is either. There are thousands of Christians of all shapes and sizes on this island. They may not all of them go after the flesh-pots, though some of them do on the sly; but they go to war and kill other people, and in peace-time make as much money as they can out of each other, and don't love their neighbours any more than I do.'
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>The Statue of Liberty is a woman. In fact, she was so good and kind to everybody, I began to wonder if perhaps she didn't like anybody at all really; but only liked being good and kind.
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>I see my fellow creatures as trees walking;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>found raymond&#8217;s humpty rejoinder to ebenezer&#8217;s question of why he doesn&#8217;t return to christine regardless of her vileness, awesome:</p>

<blockquote><p>humpty dumpty sat on a great wall,</p>

<p>humpty dumpty had a great fall,</p>

<p>all the king&#8217;s horses and all the king&#8217;s men couldn&#8217;t put humpty together again</p></blockquote>

<p>perhaps better to just mention the last line, and indirectly invoke the rest, still awesome.</p>
